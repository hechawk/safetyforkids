            In 2022 we ran a programme in 3 schools called &#39;Kids at
Risk&#39; with Young Mums Support Network, but have now
decided to set up a new venture to deal solely with the
issue of staying safe on the streets:
<br><br>
            Safety4kids CIC
<br><br>
Jason is the operations director, responsible for delivering
the courses; he has taught in over 90 schools in the UK,
providing young people with the ability to be aware of
trouble and to avoid it. Jason is a mixed martial arts
instructor, but our focus is avoiding trouble not engaging
with it!

The courses run for 5/6 weeks during school term time in
school hours and consist of a weekly one hour session,
which is designed to discuss issues that are of most
concern to the participants within a structured format
that covers a range of topics. The discussion is supported,
where appropriate with written material from Jason&#39;s
book and access to a video. This is followed by 30 minutes
of physical activity, where participants learn agility and
how to avoid trouble.
We are happy to provide separate sessions for parents to
participate and share their concerns, as well as provide
feedback on their children&#39;s reaction to the learning
experience.
